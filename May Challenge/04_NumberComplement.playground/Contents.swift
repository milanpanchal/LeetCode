# Number Complement
https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/may-leetcoding-challenge/534/week-1-may-1st-may-7th/3319/
 ---

### Problem Statement:

 Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

### Example-1:

```
 Input: 5
 Output: 2
 Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

 ```

 ### Example-2:
 
 ```
 Input: 1
 Output: 0
 Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```
 
 ### Note:
 + The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 + You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
 + This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
