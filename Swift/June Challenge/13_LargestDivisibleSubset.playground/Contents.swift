/*:
# Largest Divisible Subset
  https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/540/week-2-june-8th-june-14th/3359/

 ---

### Problem Statement:

 Given a set of `distinct` positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair (Si, Sj) of elements in this subset satisfies:

 ```Si % Sj = 0 or Sj % Si = 0.```

 If there are multiple solutions, return any subset is fine.


### Example:

 ```
 Input: [1,2,3]
 Output: [1,2] (of course, [1,3] will also be ok)

 Input: [1,2,4,8]
 Output: [1,2,4,8]

 ```
