# Sort Colors
  https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/540/week-2-june-8th-june-14th/3357/

 ---

### Problem Statement:

 Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

 Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

### Example:

 ```
 Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
 Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

 ```
 
 ### Note:
 You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.


 ### Follow up:
 + A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
 + First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
 + Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
