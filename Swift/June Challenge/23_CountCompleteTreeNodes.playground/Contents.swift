# Count Complete Tree Nodes
 https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/542/week-4-june-22nd-june-28th/3369/
 
 ---

### Problem Statement:
 Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

 Note:

 [Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)
 
 In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.



### Example:

 ```
 Input:
     1
    / \
   2   3
  / \  /
 4  5 6

 Output: 6
 ```
