# Single Number II
  https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/542/week-4-june-22nd-june-28th/3368/

 ---

### Problem Statement:

 Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

### Example:

 ```
 Input: [2,2,3,2]
 Output: 3

 Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
 Output: 99

 ```

 ### Notes:
 + Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

sol.singleNumber([0,1,0,1,0,1,99]) // 99
