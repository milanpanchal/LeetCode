# Permutation Sequence
  https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/541/week-3-june-15th-june-21st/3366/

 ---

### Problem Statement:

 The set `[1,2,3,...,n]` contains a total of n! unique permutations.

 By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

 + "123"
 + "132"
 + "213"
 + "231"
 + "312"
 + "321"
 
 Given `n` and `k`, return the `kth` permutation sequence.


### Example:

 ```
 Input: n = 3, k = 3
 Output: "213"

 Input: n = 4, k = 9
 Output: "2314"

 ```
 
 ### Notes:
 + Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
 + Given k will be between 1 and n! inclusive.
