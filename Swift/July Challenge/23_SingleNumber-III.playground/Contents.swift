# Single Number III
  https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/547/week-4-july-22nd-july-28th/3399/

 ---

### Problem Statement:

 Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.


### Example:

 ```
 Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
 Output: [3,5]

 ```
 
 ### Notes:
 + The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, `[5, 3]` is also correct.
 + Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

let sol = Solution()
sol.singleNumber([1,2,1,3,2,5]) // [3,5]
