# Hamming Distance
  https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/544/week-1-july-1st-july-7th/3381/

 ---

### Problem Statement:
 The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

 Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

### Example:

 ```
 Input: x = 1, y = 4

 Output: 2

 Explanation:
 1   (0 0 0 1)
 4   (0 1 0 0)
        ↑   ↑

 The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
 ```
 
 ### Notes:
 + 0 ≤ x, y < 2^31
